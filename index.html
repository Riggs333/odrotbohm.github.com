        <p>I am currently travelling conferences and Java User Groups with a talk called &#8220;Whoops! Where did my architecture go?&#8221;. It discusses approaches to create and maintain logical architectues in Java code bases, challenges, tools and tries to outline some ideas how one can accomplish this. A core part of the argumentation is the discussion about the importance of Java packages. Jens Schauder has written a <a href='http://blog.schauderhaft.de/2013/01/13/the-importance-of-packages/'>blog post</a> about that topic recently and I felt I had some things to add. The more I though about it I got the conclusion that a comment I envision would exceed the length of a reasonable reply I thought I&#8217;ll write up a blog post. I will point to the slides of the presentation in places where it comes in handy. The talk is also based on a lot of sample code which we will get to a bit later. The code can be found on <a href='https://github.com/olivergierke/Whoops-Architecture'>GitHub</a>.</p>

        <p>When my former Wordpress-based blog crashed quite a while ago, I didn&#8217;t really bother to set it up again as I was to busy with other things. But as I felt the urge to go beyond Twitter posts to elaborate on certain topics in the recent time I thought I&#8217;d give it yet another spin.</p>

    <h1 class='entry-title'>Spring, logging and JMX</h1>

        <p>Pretty much every application out in the wild is using logging to some extend. As applications tend to have bugs (yes, yours as well) it’s a common requirement to alter log levels at runtime. As JMX (Java Management Extensions) is a standard to monitor and manage applications it seems to be a reasonable approach to expose the loggers used in an application via JMX to allow tuning of log levels via a JMX client like jconsole. So let’s take a look on how you enable JMX with Spring.</p>

        <p>In the <code>#java.de</code> IRC channel someone pointed me to this <a href='http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-3452'>request for enhancement</a> in Hibernate recently. The bottom line here is that Hibernate’s statistics feature that can be used to capture persistence metrics (information about query executions and execution times and so on) does not include queries triggered through using the criteria API.</p>

        <p>As summer’s fading out more or less, it’s time to take a look at upcoming times. Autumn is usually quite packed with conferences and this seems to continue this year.</p>

<p>I’ll kick off my conference autumn by speaking at <a href='http://www.webappdays.de/'>WebAppDays</a> in Düsseldorf (Sept. 27th/28th) presenting <a href='http://www.springsource.org/roo'>Roo</a> as rapid java application development framework as well as giving an overview about <a href='http://www.springsource.com/products/tcserver'>tcServer</a>, the SpringSource commercial edition of <a href='http://tomcat.apache.org/'>Tomcat</a>. To not make this a marketing talk entirely, I will concentrate on how developers can benefit from tcServer usage during development and in production.</p>
