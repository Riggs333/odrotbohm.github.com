        <p>I&#8217;m quite frequently getting pulled into discussions on Twitter about the different flavors of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection'>Dependency Injection</a>. Also, I&#8217;ve repeatedly expressed my <a href='https://twitter.com/olivergierke/status/314704198908403713'>distaste for field injection</a> but as Twitter is not the right communication channel to give an in-depth rational about my opinion. So here we go.</p>

        <p>Yesterday evening, a few tweets made it into my Tweetbot column listening to tweets related to Spring Data. The one raising my attention was pointing to a blog post creatively entitled &#8221;<a href='http://movingfulcrum.tumblr.com/post/61693014502/spring-data-and-mongodb-a-mismatch-made-in-hell'>Spring Data MongoDB - A Mismatch Made In Hell</a>&#8221;. As the title already suggests, it contains a rather rigid critique of the features and design approaches we chose for the MongoDB module in the Spring Data project. The post has a very harsh tone and is equipped with a whole bunch of either deep misconceptions or deliberate refusal to see facts, which I found quite surprising. Let me go through it bit by bit and clear the dust it created.</p>

        <p><em>Jürgenization | noun | jərgenajzeʃən</em></p>

<p>The process of turning code to solve a problem at hand that might look sufficient at the first glance into rock solid, quality assured, perfectly documented and extensible code. This process might consist of a complete rewrite of the code that originally made it into the process (Karma level 0) to only minor modifications (Karma level 10), usually depending on how often the author of the code to be jürgenized has made it through the process yet.</p>

<p>The term originates from <a href='https://twitter.com/springjuergen'>Jürgen Höller</a>, Spring framework lead developer, coining this kind process to deal with code contributions about to make it into the Spring framework. To get your code into the core codebase, you and the code get jürgenized.</p>

<p>Nowadays the term usually relates to the process of code quality assurance, in particular around Spring eco-system projects.</p>
    
  

    
    <h1 class='entry-title'>Websites VS. APIs</h1>

        <p>I&#8217;ve been recently pulled into some Twitter conversations about the quality of the new open data portal &#8220;launched&#8221; by the German government available at <a href='http://govdata.de'>govdata.de</a>. I put launched in quotation marks as the launch has been a rather rocky one critized <a href='http://www.dw.de/net-activists-slam-germanys-open-data-portal/a-16611003'>through out</a> <a href='http://opengovgermany.com/2013/02/04/german-government-screws-up-open-data/'>the web</a>.</p>

<p>I in particular made fun of the very verbose <a href='http://www.govdata.de/ckan/api'><code>api</code></a> resource the portal exposes. If you do a <code>GET</code> on it all you get returned is a:</p>

<pre><code>{ &quot;version&quot; : 1 }</code></pre>

<p>What I was trying to point at - and I think most of my Twitter followers are aware that I am into the field of REST web services a bit - is that it&#8217;s absolutely sad that it&#8217;s 2013 and we still see &#8220;APIs&#8221; published to the web that lack any kind of hypermedia elements. My <a href='https://twitter.com/olivergierke/status/304562182350315520'>initial tweet</a> caused a bit of response and started some interesting conversation.</p>

        <p>I am currently travelling conferences and Java User Groups with a talk called &#8220;Whoops! Where did my architecture go?&#8221;. It discusses approaches to create and maintain logical architectues in Java code bases, challenges, tools and tries to outline some ideas how one can accomplish this. A core part of the argumentation is the discussion about the importance of Java packages. Jens Schauder has written a <a href='http://blog.schauderhaft.de/2013/01/13/the-importance-of-packages/'>blog post</a> about that topic recently and I felt I had some things to add. The more I though about it I got the conclusion that a comment I envision would exceed the length of a reasonable reply I thought I&#8217;ll write up a blog post. I will point to the slides of the presentation in places where it comes in handy. The talk is also based on a lot of sample code which we will get to a bit later. The code can be found on <a href='https://github.com/olivergierke/Whoops-Architecture'>GitHub</a>.</p>
